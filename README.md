# Awesome Writing Resources  
As a poet, storyteller and playwright I wanted a way to store all those useful tools I found while searching. I then discovered the idea of "awesome" resources on Github and as I was learning Github I figured it would be a perfect place to store this for myself. I also figurre there are other people out there who would be interested so here it is.
